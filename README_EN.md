# Machine Learning Models in Apps

Eine deutsche Anleitung finden Sie unter  [README.md](./README.md).

This repository contains two projects that demonstrate machine learning models in apps, each with an example for iOS with CoreML and Android with TensorFlow Lite.

- The [InceptionV3](./InceptionV3/README_EN.md) example recognizes fixed images such as an elephant, a daisy and strawberries (in fact raspberries).

- The [XOR example](./XOR/README_EN.md) is a simple XOR comparison. Additionally, a Keras model is included to create the CoreML and TensorFlow Lite model.

The respective examples contain their own README file with further information.
